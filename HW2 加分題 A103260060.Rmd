## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
favorite_day <- weekdays[3]
favorite_day
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
my_mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
my_mat[2,3]

my_mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
filter <- my_mat %% 2 == 1
my_mat[filter]

team_name <- c("Chicago Bulls", "Golden State Warriors")
wins <- c(72, 73)
losses <- c(10, 9)
is_champion <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
season <- c("1995-96", "2015-16")
great_nba_teams <- data.frame(team_name, wins, losses, is_champion, season, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(great_nba_teams)

great_nba_teams$ is_champion
greate_nba_teams[, "season"]
